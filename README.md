## Melissa-Web [Deprecated]
Melissa-Web is the web interface for the [Melissa-Core](https://github.com/Melissa-AI/Melissa-Core) repository. It provides a proof of concept of a web-based interface for operating Melissa on their systems.

IMPORTANT: Please note that open pull requests in this repository only if you wish to contribute to the functionality of the web interface. If you wish to enhance Melissa's capabilities, you should head over to [Melissa-Core](https://github.com/Melissa-AI/Melissa-Core). Also note that this repository will be synched with `Melissa-AI/Melissa-Core` only after certain periods of time (unless someone opens a PR to do that).

### Installation
The installation steps are essentially the same as that of Melissa-Core, however, there are a few changes to the `requirements.txt` file.

#### For OS X Systems
Clone the project using `git`. You can install git and other CLI developer tools by running the following commands:

```
xcode-select --install
```

You will need to install [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/download.html) and [PyAudio](http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/). Now run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Melissa-AI/Melissa-Web.git
cd Melissa
pip install -r requirements.txt --allow-external pywapi --allow-unverified pywapi
cp profile.yaml.default profile.yaml
cp memory.db.default memory.db
mkdir uploads
```

#### For Linux Systems
Install `git` and `espeak` using your distribution's package manager or build them from their binary files. Follow the same steps as OS X's installation system, starting from installing PortAudio and PyAudio. To play music, you will have to install [mpg123](http://www.mpg123.de).

### Configuration
Once you have successfully set up your development environment, open `profile.yaml` to customise the file and add details about yourself.
